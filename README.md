## Introduction
I came to develop this program just mostly out of summer boredom. I drive a Jeep and I thought I could do some cool 
projects by affixing a screen and a raspberry-pi in it. Just like that the Jeep Tiltometer was born! I plan on 
installing a rear view camera and using libraries such as OpenCV and TensorFlow to create some sort of obstacle 
detection and notification, so stay tuned for that. Feel free to submit a pull request and make changes or improvements 
as you see fit. I will review and merge valuable changes. Please see the section on **[contributing](#contributing)** for more details and guidelines. 
One thing that could definitely use improvement is the method of rotation I used. Pixbuf and Gdk don't support image 
rotation or very good scaling so I kind of had to hack it and just sort of animate it. A more efficient solution would 
be using Cairo or otherwise to rotate the image. Anyway thanks for visiting and enjoy!

## Requirements
This is the list of parts I used and how to configure them:
* Raspberry Pi Model 3
* LSM9DS0 IMU
* 7" Raspberry Pi [Touch Screen](http://amzn.to/2tDvX83)
* A soldering iron
* 5V power supply for the Raspberry Pi (duh)

## Installation
1. Clone repository:  `git clone https://github.com/djcopley/Tiltometer.git`
2. Enable i2c - in terminal type `sudo raspi-config` then navigate to Interfacing Options > I2C > Yes
3. Install dependencies: `sudo apt install i2c-tools libi2c-dev python-smbus python3.4` `pip3 install PyGObject`
4. Make start_tiltometer executable `chmod +x start_tiltometer.sh`

You will most likely need to solder the headers to your LSM9DS0 IMU module so start by doing that. Next we can start wiring the IMU to our Raspberry Pi.

For our purposes we need to find the I2C headers. It's the same for both models of the Raspberry Pi so if you have a different model, no need to worry.
Pin 3 and 5 are our I2C headers(GPIO  2 and 3). Connect power to 3.3v, SDA to GPIO 2, SCL to GPIO 3 and GND to... well ground of course.


After all this, you're ready to go! Just go to your Tiltometer directory and type `./start_tiltometer.sh`. Now you can go off roading with some peace of mind.
