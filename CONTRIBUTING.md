# How to contribute

Hello and welcome to my project! If you're were looking for more rules and guidelines, you've come to the right place!

If you experience any problems please make sure that your issue is detailed. If you can include exactly what events took place before the failure, that is a bonus.

## Testing

When testing your changes just be cautious. All I ask is that you make sure your update doesn't break anything.

## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request](https://github.com/djcopley/Tiltometer/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)). Also please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

## Coding conventions

Readability is key:

  * Indent using four spaces
  * ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
  * In-line comments should be preceded by two spaces `some_var = 10  # Example in-line comment`
  * Follow the [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
